# poe-trade-misc-script - [quick install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D4Enjoyer/poe-trade-misc-script/main/poe-trade-misc-script.user.js)

This userscript adds small features that either enhance the trade website or change some default behaviours.

## Features

### Any as default

Changes the default "Sale Type" from "Buyout or Fixed Price" to "Any". It simulates the necessary user input when visiting the trade website or clearing a search.

### Exchange search clearer

After selecting an item on the Bulk Item Exchange, the search bar will be cleared to remove highlights from items matching the search.

### Fuzzy search

Inserts a tilde (~) to the search bar and stat filters on the trade website in order to enable fuzzy search. When using an asterisk (\*) as a wild-card in custom searches, fuzzy search will be automatically disabled. Starting a search with a space will disable it aswell.

### Open Exchange filters

Opens filters (e.g. Fragments & Sets, Essences) when visiting the Bulk Item Exchange. To change the default filters that are opened, search for "Customize here" in the script then change the true/false values to your liking.

### Show filters on clear

Clearing a search on the trade website shows the filters without having to manually click the "Show Filters" button.
